# DISCONTINUED, USE [ACEDIUM](https://github.com/ferriarnus/acedium)

## Revidium

Revidium was a fork of Nvidium, an alternate rendering backing for sodium. It used cutting edge nvidia features to render huge amounts of
terrain geometry at very playable framerates. The difference was that Revidium was for embeddium (Forge) and was used with Sinytra Connector.

This project seems to have achieved my goal of pressuring an actual competent developer to make Nvidium for forge, so I lay Nvidium's dead body here. Thank you [ferriarnus](https://github.com/ferriarnus) for making this possible.

### Required Embeddium and an Nvidia GTX 1600 series or newer to run (Turing+ architecture)
